        <div class="main_summary">
            <p class="main-info">When you think of events that shaped world history as we know it, wars are what often come to mind. Violence changes our society in an indisputable way. In the realm of wars, few were greater and more impactful than the first World War. Within that World War, nothing was more impactful than the Central Powers. Their combined forces caused millions of deaths and huge amounts of damage in a way that affected the world for years after, while also destroying one of their own in the process. Along with that, the Central Powers were a huge, if not the main, part of starting WWI. Between Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire, the Central Powers' impact in WWI and subsequently the World is undeniable.

                <p class="importance-reason">
                    In the first World War, the Central Powers mobilized over 25 million soldiers. 3.1 million were killed and 8.4 million were wounded. These deaths were a direct cause of the Central Powers. Without them, the soldiers wouldn’t have been mobilized and later killed. They also destroyed boats and large sea crafts through unrestricted submarine warfare (this was mostly Germany). These are just some of the examples of the destruction caused by the Central Powers.

                    Have you ever heard of the Ottoman Empire? What about Turkey? The Ottoman Empire was the land of Turkey before it was Turkey. Although the Turkish National Movement was started in 1908, the final push came from WWI. The Ottoman Empire had strong economic ties to Germany so they joined the Central Powers as a means of gaining more power. However, this led to their downfall. The Central Powers were so unmovable that they ended up destroying one of their own allies.

                    Arguably one of the most influential events in history, World War One was caused by the Central Powers. Although it may not seem like that at first, the Central Powers, or essentially Austria-Hungary and Germany, were the root of WWI’s causes. The Black Hand, a Serbian-Nationalist terrorist group, assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary. As a result, Austria-Hungary (a central power) declared war on Serbia. After Russia joined with Serbia, Germany joined Austria-Hungary against Russia and Serbia. This formed the original Central Powers with the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria joining later. The Central Powers were obviously important and impactful because they initially started WWI, one of the most impactful events in history.
